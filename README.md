# GiphySquirrel
JS API key School Project
# Giphy Search Engine
**Author:** Jacob Mackey

## Overview
A single-page app that allows users to search Giphy and view results in a responsive, flex-based grid.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` (or run a local server).
2. Enter a search term in the search box and press Search (or Enter).
3. GIFs will be displayed. Click a GIF to preview or copy the URL.

## Files
- `index.html` — main markup
- `style.css` — compiled CSS
- `main.js` — JavaScript to call Giphy API and render results

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- SASS (style.scss)
- Vanilla JavaScript (fetch API)
- Google Fonts (Fraunces)

## Ideas for future improvement
1. Add infinite scroll and smarter caching of queries.
2. Add user favorites (persisted in localStorage).
3. Implement a server-side proxy to keep the API key secret.
4. Add animated hover previews and improved lightbox with GIF playback controls.
